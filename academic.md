# Academic Poster Tips with Canva

Here are some tips for creating an academic poster using Canva. If you have any questions, please ask! 

**1. Option A: Use an Academic Poster template:**
  -If you want to work with a template, you can click here to access our template based on the #BetterPoster format (see right), and start working on it: [UVic themed #BetterPoster template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFYzpd1yU8/olf9xuPArpgDg7WZmWMIQA/view?utm_content=DAFYzpd1yU8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview){:target="_blank"}
  
**2. Option B: Build your own:**
  -If you want to start from a blank page: From the Canva.com home page, click on the **Create A Design** button in the upper right corner, and then click on **Custom Size** at the bottom of the drop-down. This will open up a list of options for Width and Height. You can change the smaller drop-down here from **“px”** (which is short for pixels) to **“in”** (short for inches) if you have a specific printed poster size you need. 54” x 36” of 48” by 36” are common sizes for full size, printed academic posters. Click on **Create New Design** below this once you’ve entered the dimensions you want. 
  -Note: there are not any Canva-created templates for academic posters. You can put **poster** in the upper left **search templates** field and see if there are any with elements that will be a good starting base for your poster. 
  -Once you have picked a starting point for your poster, you can click on **Styles** in the upper left corner for even more ideas. Here you can find **Color Palattes** and **Font Sets**. If you click on an individual palette multiple times, this will cycle your design through various ways the same colour combo can display in the design.
